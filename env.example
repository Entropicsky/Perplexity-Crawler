# Perplexity Research Suite - Environment Configuration Example
# Rename this file to .env and fill in your actual API keys

# Required API Keys
PERPLEXITY_API_KEY=your-perplexity-api-key-here
FIRECRAWL_API_KEY=your-firecrawl-api-key-here

# Models Configuration
# Model options for Perplexity:
# - sonar-medium-online: Good balance of speed and quality (recommended for most cases)
# - sonar-deep-research: Best quality for research, slower and more expensive
# - mixtral-8x7b-instruct: Good for content formatting
PERPLEXITY_RESEARCH_MODEL=sonar-deep-research
PERPLEXITY_CLEANUP_MODEL=sonar-pro

# API Rate Limiting and Error Handling
# Adjust these settings to control rate limit protection
API_MAX_RETRIES=3                 # Maximum number of retry attempts for rate-limited calls
API_INITIAL_RETRY_DELAY=5.0       # Starting delay in seconds before retrying
API_MAX_RETRY_DELAY=60.0          # Maximum delay cap in seconds

# Performance Tuning
# Adjust these settings to balance speed vs. API rate limits
RATE_LIMIT_QUESTIONS_PER_WORKER=7 # Higher value = fewer workers (reduces parallel API calls)
THREAD_STAGGER_DELAY=5.0           # Seconds to wait between starting workers (0 = no delay)

# Additional Settings (optional)
# DEFAULT_TEMPERATURE=0.2         # Controls randomness in responses (0.0-1.0)
